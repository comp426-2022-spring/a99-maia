# a99 Final Project

## MentalLog

![MentalLog logo](front/assets/lightlogo.svg)

MentalLog is a web application that allows individuals to keep records of their daily moods in the form of a journal, using a mood scale and an option to enter any text about details of their day. The users will be able to see trends and a summary about their mood on the home page in the form of a graph, as well as mental health resources if their trends show concerns or they mark a day unusually low. This application can help people keep track of their moods and take care of their mental health and find resources as needed.
